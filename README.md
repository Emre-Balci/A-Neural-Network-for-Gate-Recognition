# A Neural Network for Gate Recognition
A simple neural network example for logic gate recognition. This network can recognize 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'nand' gates after training with an average error of %1. The data sets used in training are generated randomly each time and testing data sets are chosen randomly among training data sets.
